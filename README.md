# Excel-Projects-Analyzing-Bike-Sales-Data

In this project I have analysed a dataset on bike sales using Excel and created an interactive dashboard. 



From the results it is clear to see that the number of bike purhcase decreases as the number of cars per household increases (Bottom left chart). 
Another finding is that people tend to buy bikes if their commute distance is lower (Top right chart).
